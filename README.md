# Cluster Network
This project implements a private network (similar to a VPN) to connect one or more clients to a server cluster. The main goal is to enable secure, efficient, and dedicated communication between external devices and the cluster nodes.

The network setup allows clients to access the cluster as if all nodes were on the same local network, ensuring security, isolation, and scalability.
